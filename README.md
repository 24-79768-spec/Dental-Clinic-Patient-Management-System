The DCPMS uses a strict MVC pattern showcasing three subjects. 
OOP is fulfilled by embedding entity classes and business logic in controller.py. 
DBMS uses database.py (connection) and model.py (CRUD via MySQL). 
ACP is satisfied by isolating the Tkinter GUI in view.py. main.py orchestrates 
all layer communications for modularity and separation of concerns.
